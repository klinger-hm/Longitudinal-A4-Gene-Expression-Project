The data used for this project includes **all** A4 and LEARN participants (including screen fails) with Autosomal and X-linked RNAseq data available (N = 1,737). The longitudinal data includes all available follow up, including the open label period.

Project Aims:

1.  Test the association of gene expression with longitudinal PACC, longitudinal amyloid, longitudinal tau, longitudinal ptau, and baseline ptau.

2.  See if these associations are modified by sex, APOEe4 status, sex x APOEe4 status, amyloid burden, amyloid burden x sex.

Sensitivity Analyses:

1.  Run significant sex moderated models in just females and just males.

2.  Run analyses in just LEARN vs A4 Placebo and LEARN vs A4 Treated.
